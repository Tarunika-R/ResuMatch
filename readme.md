## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Upload resume (.pdf / .docx)
- 🎯 Predict job role using trained ML model
- 🤖 Semantic similarity score between resume and JD using Sentence Transformers
- 📊 Resume fit score based on string similarity between applied and predicted role
- 🧠 Suggestions for missing keywords
- 📥 PDF report generation
- 📧 Report auto-emailed to user
- 🗃️ All evaluations logged in SQLite DB
- 🎨 Split-screen UI with SweetAlert notification

## 🧠 Model and Architecture

- **ML Role Classifier:** Trained with `TF-IDF + LogisticRegression`
- **Semantic Evaluation:** via `SentenceTransformer ('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')`
- **Resume-JD Score:** Cosine similarity
- **Resume Role Fit Score:** via `difflib.SequenceMatcher`
- **PDF Report:** Generated using `fpdf`

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. User uploads resume and enters:
   - Applied role
   - Job description
   - Email
2. Model predicts the role from resume text
3. Semantic similarity between resume and JD is computed
4. Resume fit score is calculated using text similarity
5. Feedback and missing keywords are generated
6. PDF is created and emailed to user
7. Everything is logged into a database

## 📧 Gmail SMTP Setup

1. Enable **2-Step Verification** on your Gmail account.
2. Visit: [App Passwords](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords)
3. Generate an **App Password** and update in `app.py`:
   ```python
   sender_email = "your_email@gmail.com"
   sender_password = "your_generated_app_password"
   ```

## 🧪 Local Setup

1. Clone the repo
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Tarunika-R/ResuMatch.git
   cd resume-evaluator
   ```
2. Create virtual environment
   ```bash
